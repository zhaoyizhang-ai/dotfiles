# Related Work Writing

Generate publication-quality Related Work sections with proper citations and thematic organization.

## Input

- `$0` — Current paper draft or method description
- `$1` — Collected literature (BibTeX entries, paper summaries, or literature review notes)

## References

- Related work writing prompts and strategies: `~/.claude/skills/related-work-writing/references/related-work-prompts.md`

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze the Paper's Contributions
- Read the current paper draft (especially Methods and Introduction)
- Identify the key contributions and novelty claims
- List the technical components that need literature context

### Step 2: Organize Literature by Theme
Group related papers into thematic clusters:
- Each cluster should represent a research direction or technique
- Common themes: problem formulation, methodology family, application domain, evaluation approach
- Order themes from most to least relevant to your work

### Step 3: Write Each Theme Paragraph
For each thematic group:
1. **Topic sentence** — Introduce the research direction
2. **Describe key works** — Summarize 2-5 representative papers
3. **Compare and contrast** — How does each approach differ from yours?
4. **Transition** — Connect to the next theme or to your contribution

### Step 4: Refine
- Ensure every cited paper has a clear reason for inclusion
- Check that your work's novelty is clear from the comparisons
- Verify all `\cite{}` keys exist in the `.bib` file
- Aim for 1-2 pages (single column) or 0.5-1 page (double column)

## Rules

- **Compare and contrast, don't just describe** — "Unlike [X] which assumes..., our method..."
- **Organize by theme, not chronologically** — Group by research direction
- **Cite broadly** — Not just the most popular papers; include recent and diverse work
- **Be fair** — Acknowledge strengths of prior work before stating limitations
- **Explain inapplicability** — If a method could apply to your setting, explain why you don't compare experimentally, or add it to experiments
- **Use present tense for established facts** — "Smith et al. propose..." or "This approach uses..."
- **End with positioning** — The final paragraph should clearly position your work relative to all discussed prior work
