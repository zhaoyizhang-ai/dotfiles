# LaTeX Academic Paper Assistant (English)

Use this skill for targeted work on an existing English LaTeX paper project. Keep the workflow low-friction: identify the right module, run the smallest useful check, and return actionable comments in LaTeX-friendly review format.

## Capability Summary

- Compile and diagnose LaTeX build failures.
- Audit formatting, bibliography, grammar, sentence length, argument logic, and figure quality.
- Diagnose and rewrite-plan literature review sections around thematic synthesis, comparison, and gap derivation.
- Review IEEE-style pseudocode blocks, figure-wrapped algorithms, captions, labels, comments, and algorithm package choices.
- Improve expression, translate academic prose, optimize titles, and reduce AI-writing traces.
- Review experiment sections without rewriting citations, labels, or math.

## Triggering

Use this skill when the user has an existing English `.tex` paper project and wants help with:

- compiling or fixing build errors
- format or venue compliance
- bibliography and citation validation
- grammar, sentence, logic, or expression review
- literature review restructuring, related-work synthesis, or research-gap derivation
- translation of academic prose
- title optimization
- figure or caption quality checks
- pseudocode and algorithm-block review
- de-AI editing of visible prose
- experiment-section analysis

## Do Not Use

Do not use this skill for:

- planning or drafting a paper from scratch
- deep literature research or fact-finding without a paper project
- Chinese thesis-specific structure/template work
- Typst-first paper workflows
- DOCX/PDF conversion tasks that do not involve the LaTeX source
- multi-perspective review, scoring, or submission gate decisions (use `paper-audit`)
- standalone algorithm design from scratch without a paper project

## Module Router

| Module | Use when | Primary command | Read next |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `compile` | Build fails or the user wants a fresh compile | `uv run python -B $SKILL_DIR/scripts/compile.py main.tex` | `references/modules/COMPILE.md` |
| `format` | User asks for LaTeX or venue formatting review | `uv run python -B $SKILL_DIR/scripts/check_format.py main.tex` | `references/modules/FORMAT.md` (load `templates/<venue>.md` instead of the full `references/VENUES.md` when a venue is named) |

| `figures` | Figure existence, extension, DPI, or caption review | `uv run python -B $SKILL_DIR/scripts/check_figures.py main.tex` | `references/REVIEWER_PERSPECTIVE.md` |
| `pseudocode` | IEEE-safe pseudocode review, `algorithm2e` cleanup, caption/label/reference checks, and comment-length review | `uv run python -B $SKILL_DIR/scripts/check_pseudocode.py main.tex --venue ieee` | `references/modules/PSEUDOCODE.md` |
| `deai` | Reduce AI-writing traces while preserving LaTeX syntax | `uv run python -B $SKILL_DIR/scripts/deai_check.py main.tex --section introduction` | `references/modules/DEAI.md` |
| `experiment` | Inspect experiment design/write-up quality, discussion depth, discussion layering, and conclusion completeness | `uv run python -B $SKILL_DIR/scripts/analyze_experiment.py main.tex --section experiments` | `references/modules/EXPERIMENT.md` |
| `tables` | Table structure validation, three-line table generation, or booktabs review | `uv run python -B $SKILL_DIR/scripts/check_tables.py main.tex` | `references/modules/TABLES.md` |
| `abstract` | Abstract five-element structure diagnosis and word count validation | `uv run python -B $SKILL_DIR/scripts/analyze_abstract.py main.tex` | `references/modules/ABSTRACT.md` |
| `adapt` | Journal adaptation: reformat paper for a different venue | (LLM-driven workflow) | references/modules/ADAPT.md |

## Routing Rules

- Infer the module from the user request before asking follow-up questions. Ask for the module only when two or more modules are equally plausible after keyword routing.
- If the user asks for 2-3 compatible checks in one turn, run them sequentially instead of forcing a single-module reply.
- Use this execution order when multiple modules are needed: `compile` -> `bibliography` -> `format` -> `figures` / `tables` / `pseudocode` -> `grammar` / `sentences` / `deai` -> `logic` / `literature` / `experiment` -> `title` / `expression` / `translation` / `adapt`.
- Prefer `logic` for cross-section alignment requests (abstract vs introduction vs conclusion), introduction funnel issues, or contribution drift; prefer `literature` only when the problem is specifically about Related Work organization, comparison, or gap derivation.
- Keep `experiment` for results, discussion, baseline, ablation, significance, limitation, and conclusion-completeness concerns even if the user phrases them as "logic" problems.
- When a script fails, stop the current module, report the exact command plus exit code, and recommend the next smallest useful fallback instead of silently switching modules.

## Required Inputs

- `main.tex` or the paper entrypoint.
- Optional `--section SECTION` when the request is section-specific.
- Optional bibliography path when the request targets references.
- Optional venue/context when the user cares about IEEE, ACM, Springer, NeurIPS, or ICML conventions.

If arguments are missing, preserve the inferred module and ask only for the missing file path, section, bibliography path, or venue context.

## Output Contract

- Return findings in LaTeX diff-comment style whenever possible: `% MODULE (Line N) [Severity] [Priority]: Issue ...`
- Keep comments surgical and source-aware.
- Report the exact command used and the exit code when a script fails.
- Preserve `\cite{}`, `\ref{}`, `\label{}`, custom macros, and math environments unless the user explicitly asks for source edits.
- For `literature`, default to diagnosis + rewrite blueprint first; only produce paragraph-level rewriting when the user explicitly asks for prose.

## Workflow

1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS`, infer the smallest matching module, and keep that inference unless the user explicitly redirects you.
2. Read only the reference file needed for that module.
3. If the request contains multiple compatible concerns, run them in the routing order above and keep the output grouped by module.
4. Run the module script with `uv run python -B ...`.
5. Summarize issues, suggested fixes, and blockers in LaTeX-friendly comments.
6. If the user asks for a different concern, switch modules instead of overloading one run.

## Safety Boundaries

- Don't invent citations, metrics, baselines, or experimental results — fabricated evidence is harder to retract once the user trusts it than a clearly flagged gap.
- Leave `\cite{}`, `\ref{}`, `\label{}`, custom macros, and math environments untouched by default — a stray edit there is far harder to spot in a diff than a prose edit, and breaks compilation silently.
- Treat generated prose as proposals, not commits — keep source-preserving checks separate from rewriting so the user can validate each step.

## Reference Map

- `references/STYLE_GUIDE.md`: tone and style defaults.
- `references/VENUES.md`: full venue catalog (treat as index; prefer `templates/<venue>.md` for IEEE / ACM / NeurIPS / ICML / Springer LNCS).
- `templates/`: per-venue snapshots loaded on demand. Files: `ieee.md`, `acm.md`, `neurips.md`, `icml.md`, `springer-lncs.md`.
- `references/CITATION_VERIFICATION.md`: citation verification workflow.
- `references/REVIEWER_PERSPECTIVE.md`: reviewer-style heuristics for figures and clarity.
- `references/modules/`: module-by-module commands and decision notes.
- `references/modules/PSEUDOCODE.md`: IEEE-safe defaults for LaTeX pseudocode.

Read only the file that matches the active module.

## Example Requests

- “Compile my IEEE paper and tell me why `main.tex` still fails after BibTeX.”
- “Check the introduction section for grammar and sentence length, but do not rewrite equations.”
- “Audit figures and references in this ACM submission before I submit.”
- “Rewrite the related work so it reads like a synthesis instead of a paper-by-paper list, but keep all citation anchors intact.”
- “Check whether this IEEE pseudocode still uses `algorithm2e` floats and tell me how to make it IEEE-safe.”
- “Review the experiments section for overclaiming, missing ablations, and weak baseline comparisons.”
