# Paper Revision

Systematically revise papers based on reviewer feedback.

## Input

- `$0` — Reviewer comments/feedback
- `$1` — Current paper draft (main.tex or paper directory)

## References

- Revision workflow and prompts: `~/.claude/skills/paper-revision/references/revision-prompts.md`

## Workflow

### Step 1: Parse and Prioritize Concerns
For each reviewer comment:
1. Extract the specific concern
2. Classify: major revision, minor revision, question, suggestion
3. Map to affected paper section(s)
4. Prioritize: address major concerns first

### Step 2: Plan Revisions
Create a revision plan:
```
Concern → Affected Section → Required Action → New Content/Experiment
```

Categories of actions:
- **Clarification**: Rewrite text for clarity
- **Additional experiment**: Run new experiment, add results
- **New analysis**: Add ablation, statistical test, or comparison
- **Structural change**: Move, merge, or split sections
- **Citation**: Add missing references

### Step 3: Execute Revisions
For each planned revision:
1. Read the current section
2. Apply targeted edits (preserve surrounding structure)
3. If new experiments needed: use experiment-code skill
4. If new figures/tables needed: use figure-generation / table-generation skills
5. Mark changes (use `\textcolor{blue}{...}` for revised text)

### Step 4: Verify Improvements
- Re-run self-review skill to check if scores improved
- Verify all reviewer concerns are addressed
- Check that revisions don't introduce new issues
- Ensure page count still fits venue requirements

### Step 5: Write Revision Summary
Generate a diff summary:
- List all changes made with section references
- Note any new experiments, figures, or tables added
- Cross-reference each change to the reviewer concern it addresses

## Rules

- Address EVERY reviewer concern — do not skip any
- Preserve paper structure unless structural change is explicitly needed
- New results must come from actual experiments, not hallucinated
- Mark all revised text clearly for the reviewers
- Keep a copy of the previous version before revising
- Compare new scores vs previous scores after revision
